I confirm that this submission is my own work and is consistent with the
Queen's regulations on Academic Integrity. 

1. I hypothesize that double hashing will produce the required performance
standards with a smaller table size than quadratic probing. The latter,
while good at avoiding primary clustering, is occasionally prone to
secondary clustering. Due to this, I expect double hashing, with correctly
chosen tables sizes and hashing functions, will produce better results.

2. To translate a string to an integer value, I will sum the ASCII values
of each character in the string, then do modular division by m, the number
of spaces in the table, to ensure the number always falls in the tableâ€™s
range.

3. I based my experiments off the models used on code2begin.blogspot.com, linked here:

http://code2begin.blogspot.com/2017/01/hashing-with-quadratic-probing.html

This was the framework I used, editing it to fit my needs and to ensure I understood
what each piece of code was doing itself. I also implemented my own hash function.
